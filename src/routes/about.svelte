      TL;DR - I'm a Pittsburgh-born, former humanitarian worker, current
      software engineer, based in Glasgow, enjoying being in one place after a
      long nomadic period.

      Hey there, I'm Josh! I'm a Glasgow-based Software Engineer, by way of
      Kenya, South Sudan, Washington DC, The Gambia, and Pittsburgh. I became a
      programmer in a bit of a roundabout way: I originally studied Public
      Policy and wanted to be an urban planner, but the 2008 financial crisis
      forced me into the consulting world, which bored me into a drive for
      adventure in the aid and development sector across sub-Saharan Africa. My
      work increasingly required the use of technological tools, and I
      increasingly wanted to be able to make and adjust the tools myself. I
      participated in a bootcamp in London in 2015, and have been a software
      engineer since.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being a Software Engineer satisfies my drive for always learning new
      things. While staying on top of new technologies, trends, and best
      practices is a challenge, it's definitely a welcome one.

      I am primarily a JavaScript developer, with most of my time spent on
      frontend web development. I do a bit of backend stuff too, and even some
      DevOps, mostly NodeJS/Express, Postgres, and AWS. For the past year I've
      written JavaScript almost exclusively with Typescript. Aside from Svelte
      projects where there is not good Typescript support (yet), I plan on only
      working in Typescript from now on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the years I've had the pleasure to work with other languages too;
      PHP, Ruby, Java, etc. I'm no expert in any of them, but I certainly know
      enough to navigate an existing code base.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am currently learning and re-learning some languages and frameworks that
      I write about in my
      <a href="blog">blog,</a>
      including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Rust;</li>
      <li>CSS-Grid & Flexbox;</li>
      <li>Svelte; and</li>
      <li>Docker.</li>
    </ul>

      When I'm not writing code I try to get outside and enjoy the Scottish
      outdoors as much as possible. I love hiking, running, cycling, and
      foraging. The weather here is not always conducive to outdoor activities,
      so when I'm stuck inside I like to cook, ferment/pickle what I've foraged,
      and read, mostly fiction. I might write about this stuff too ðŸ˜¬.
